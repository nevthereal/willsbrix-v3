# Will's Brix

## About this repository
The official repository of [willsbrix.com](https://wilsbrix.com!) This repository contains a lot of efficiency changes to the [older repository](https://github.com/nevthereal/willsbrix-v2), such as using Vite, making the code more efficient with Dynamic Panel Components (see Home.jsx and Products.jsx) and the addition of the productList.js. I also implemented a better cart functionality, since I want to go away from the Paypal Buttons system and use Stripe to handle payments. Right now everything is working, except that I somehow can't connect to the server. But it will be fixed soon.

## Technologies used:

- Vite + React
- TailwindCSS
- Font Awesome (Icons)
- Paypal Buttons
