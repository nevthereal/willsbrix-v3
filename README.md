## About this repository
The official repository of [willsbrix.com](https://wilsbrix.com!) This repository contains a lot of efficiency changes to the [older repository](https://github.com/nevthereal/willsbrix-v2), such as using Vite, making the code more efficient with Dynamic Panel Components (see Home.jsx and Products.jsx) and the addition of the productList.js. I also implemented a better cart functionality, since I want to go away from the Paypal Buttons system and use Stripe to handle payments.
